      <description>When a new kind of job is required for backend processing, it has to be done properly in order to ensure it is used, set up, and processed by NCA.
Make sure there aren&amp;rsquo;t already existing jobs that do what you want! There are a lot of jobs in NCA already, and some are meant to be very generic, such as JobTypeRenameDir. Read and make sure you understand all structs in src/jobs that implement Process Create a new JobType in src/models/job.</description>

      <title>Add Configuration Settings</title>

      <description>Occasionally we need a new setting to be created so that users have a bit more control over the inner workings of NCA. This details the process of adding settings:
Open up src/config/config.go and add a value to the Config struct. Choose the data type. In most cases a primitive is fine: string, int, float64, etc. Decide if the value should be pulled directly from the settings file or if you need to massage data manually.</description>

      <title>Add Privileges / Roles</title>
      <link>https://uoregon-libraries.github.io/newspaper-curation-app/contributing/dev-howto/add-privileges/</link>

      <description>New privileges require a lot of different changes in order to create them, tie them to a role, and then have NCA use them.
Edit src/privilege/role.go if the new privilege(s) are going to be tied to an entirely new role. Edit src/privilege/privilege.go and add the item in the big list of vars. You have to define what role(s) can have said privilege. Super-admins always have all privileges and aren&amp;rsquo;t specified explicitly, but the privilege does require a definition, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just an empty role list.</description>
