<main><h1>Fixing &#34;Stuck&#34; Issues</h1>
<p>Sometimes a publisher will upload a broken PDF that NCA cannot process.  There
is a safeguard against these kinds of issues: only queue uploaded issues after
careful review.  But it&rsquo;s often infeasible to do this, especially if you have
enough publishers that you get hundreds of pages uploaded each week.</p>
<p>When an issue gets stuck, NCA currently has no way to indicate this.  This is
one area where a developer used to have to clean up the filesystem and database
manually.  As of NCA v3.8.0, there is a tool which can handle this in a
significantly less painful way.</p>
<h2 id="purging-dead-issues">Purging Dead Issues</h2>
<p>A normal invocation of <code>make</code> creates <code>bin/purge-dead-issues</code>.  This is a
destructive operation, and you will need to be prepared prior to running it so
that you can decide how best to handle the broken issues.  Please read this
document fully!</p>
<p>When run, <code>purge-dead-issues</code> will do a lot of logging to STDERR, print out a
&ldquo;report&rdquo; of which issues were purged, and write a <code>purge.json</code> file describing
each purged issue in some detail.</p>
<p>By default, <code>purge-dead-issues</code> will not actually make any changes.  It scans
the database and reports the issues which would be purged, but it doesn&rsquo;t
actually purge them.  Because the process is exactly the same as a live run,
this allows you to carefully review what will happen without anything
destructive occurring.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready, run the command with the <code>--live</code> flag.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>Under the hood, this command does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finds all issues that are valid candidates for purging.  To be valid, an issue:
<ul>
<li>Is in the &ldquo;awaiting processing&rdquo; state</li>
<li>Has at least one failed job - as in &ldquo;failed&rdquo;, which means failed forever,
not <code>failed_done</code>, which indicates a temporary failure which was retried.</li>
<li>Is not tied to a batch</li>
<li>Has no jobs that are pending or in process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ends all jobs that were stuck - this means failed jobs as well as any &ldquo;on
hold&rdquo; jobs that had been waiting for a failed jobs to finish</li>
<li>Creates a new job to purge the issue.  This uses the same logic as issues
that are flagged as having errors and removed from NCA.</li>
</ul>
<p>All operations are just database changes, and as such a transaction is able to
wrap the entire command.  A single critical failure of any kind prevents any
changes from being made, ensuring a pretty safe run.</p>
<p>In fact, when <code>--live</code> is not specified, the transaction is rolled back right
before the code would normally commit it.  This is why the command is able to
give a complete report as if everything had been run without altering the
application&rsquo;s state in any way.</p>
