    Load the batch on production; load it on staging as well if your staging
    environment mirrors production:
  </p>
  {{template "batch-manual-load" .Data.Batch}}

  <p>Then mark it as "live":</p>
  <form action="{{SetLiveURL .Data.Batch}}" method="POST">

  <!-- On production, copied to archive location, needs to be flagged for the

  {{else if and .Data.Batch.ReadyForArchive (.Data.Can.Archive .Data.Batch)}}
  <p><strong>{{.Data.Batch.Name}} is live and has been copied to the archival location.</strong></p>
  <p>
    When the archive has been finalized, flag it as complete below. This starts
    a <strong>28-day</strong> countdown, after which NCA deletes <em>all local
    issues' files</em> from disk.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your archival location is the final destination for archives, you can
    activate this at any time. If you move files to a location where they are
    batch-archived at a later date, activate this after the batch archive
    occurs to ensure the countdown doesn't start until the files have actually
    started moving to the final archive.
