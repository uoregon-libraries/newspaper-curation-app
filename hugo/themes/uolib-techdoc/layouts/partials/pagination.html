<nav class="pagination" aria-label="Pagination">
<!--
  Pagination is screwy:

  - "Prev*" and "Next*" mean the reverse in hugo parlance
  - A page with subpages needs its "next" link to be the first child
  - A page with no previous sibling needs to go back to its parent, if one exists
  - A page with no next sibling needs to go to the next available sibling of its parent, if any exist

  This is too much to get working properly, so instead we're relying on hacky
  .Scratch settings that were built up in the sidebar template, since it does a
  lot of recursive looping to build the navigation.
