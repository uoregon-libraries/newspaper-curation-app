## These documents

We're always trying to improve the documentation experience, and we're aware
these docs are incomplete and in some cases probably too specific to UO's
setup.  Pull requests are appreciated!

For keyboard users: note that the sidebar is implemented as a tree widget (more
or less following the W3C example of an accessible navigation tree). This means:

- The widget as a whole is a single tab stop
- Once focus is in the widget, use arrow keys to navigate: up and down move
  through links while right and left open and close submenus. There are some
  other handy keyboard features for jumping around the list, but arrow keys are
  likely all you'll need to know.
- Enter or spacebar will open whichever link is active within the tree.

## Project

This project consists of various scripts for converting
[born-digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-digital) PDF newspapers, as
well as scanned newspapers, into a one-batch
[bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) which can be ingested into
[ONI](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni) and
[chronam](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/chronam).

See the documentation links in the sidebar for semi-organized, sort-of-helpful
kinda-in-depth information.
