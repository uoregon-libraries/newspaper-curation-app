title: NCA Terms, Specs, and Information
weight: 20
description: Developing on NCA

NCA has a lot of newspaper-specific terminology as well as custom terms and
specs we use / adhere to.  This section should help a bit with understanding
how NCA operates, and what words mean what things.

**WIP**: This is a massive work in progress and is still very much in need of
love.  Please feel free to [submit an issue][1] if you run into a confusing
term or a specification that doesn't seem to have any explanation.
