This section will take you through the steps necessary to install the NCA tools
on your system.

Note that developer setup is likely to differ greatly from a production
install, as you'll need tools (such as Go and/or Docker) that production setups
can do without.  See [Contributing](/contributing) for a rundown of how to get
started doing development (and other contribution-related tasks).
