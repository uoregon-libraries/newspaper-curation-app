description: Setting up a new NCA toolsuite

Creating a publisher in NCA, at least for UO, requires several manual processes
take place:

- Add a title to NCA with sftp credential information.
- If necessary, import the title's MARC record to your ONI site (for example,
  oregonnews.uoregon.edu).
  - See [Adding Titles](/workflow/adding-titles) for details
- Set up a user for sftp access
  - We use NCA's integrated SFTPGo setup for this. See
    [SFTPGo Integration](/setup/sftpgo-integration).
