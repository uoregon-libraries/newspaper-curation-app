Creating a publisher in NCA, at least for UO, requires several manual processes
take place:

- See our [Adding Titles][1] documentation for getting a title into NCA and
  your ONI instances, as the process differs depending on whether your titles'
  records already exist.
- Set up a user for sftp access if you aren't using the SFTPGo integration (but
  you really should, it's way easier).
- Get SFTP credentials to your publisher, and make sure they're aware of any
  regular maintenance windows you might need on your SFTP server. Broken
  uploads can be a pain to fix!
- Familiarize yourself *and your publishers* with [the upload specs][2],
  particularly for born-digital content.
