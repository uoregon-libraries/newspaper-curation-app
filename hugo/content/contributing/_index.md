We welcome contributions to NCA in a variety of forms.  This section will help
you to understand how NCA is laid out on the code side as well as how to
perform certain complex tasks.

And as always, this is primarily for my own benefit, so if something is
confusing, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/newspaper-curation-app/issues)
or submit a pull request if you feel these documents could be improved!
