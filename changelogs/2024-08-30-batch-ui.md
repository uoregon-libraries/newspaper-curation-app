### Fixed


### Added

- New area in NCA's web UI for generating batches! The command-line tool will
  continue to exist, but this UI makes it so that people without shell access
  can easily generate batches on demand.

### Changed

- The nav item "Batches" has been renamed to "Manage Batches" so it's purpose
  is clearer now that we have a second batch-related nav item.

### Migration

- Shut down NCA workers and HTTP daemon. You will have potentially several
  minutes of downtime.
- Run database migrations to add the new page count field and then count pages
  for every issue in the database:
  - `make && ./bin/migrate-database -c ./settings up`
- Restart services.
