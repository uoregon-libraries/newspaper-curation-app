### Fixed

- The `localdev.sh` command for migrating the database now ensures the migrate
  command is built first

### Added

- NCA auto-creates various workflow directories if they don't exist. This
  simplifies our docker setup as well as reducing out-of-sync situations when
  the docker entrypoint didn't properly reflect all necessary directories.

### Changed

- Minimum wait times for uploaded issues to be queued are now configurable
  instead of hard-coded! Yay!

### Migration

- Configure NCA's new settings:
  - `DURATION_ISSUE_CONSIDERED_DANGEROUS`: How long after upload an issue must
    wait before it's allowed to be queued for curation
  - `DURATION_ISSUE_CONSIDERED_NEW`: How long after upload an issue gives a
    warning about being new
