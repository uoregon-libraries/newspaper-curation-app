### Changed

- All invocations of `docker-compose` are now `docker compose` (note the space
  instead of the hyphen) so people installing docker and compose in the past
  year or two aren't confused (or laughing at how outdated NCA is).

### Migration

- Make sure you have compose installed as a plugin, as detailed in Docker's
  [documentation][compose-install].
