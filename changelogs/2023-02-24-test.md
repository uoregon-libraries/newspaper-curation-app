### Added

- New document added to the "test" directory to help explain how to create data
  and use helper scripts when manually testing NCA in a real-world-like setting
- New test script to enter and review dummy metadata for quicker testing

### Removed

- Most manual testing documentation in hugo has been removed in favor of the
  test directory being more self-documenting. We chose to gut the hugo side
  because our approach to manual testing is likely to be very UO-specific.
