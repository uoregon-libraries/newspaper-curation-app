### Changed

- Batch generation had a minor refactor as part of the preliminary work for
  batch generation from the website (instead of being command-line only).
  Changes should go mostly unnoticed, but there are a few differences to how
  issue queues get split into batches, the command-line tool's logging is
  different, etc.
