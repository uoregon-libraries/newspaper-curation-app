### Fixed

- All linting / validation tooling is now properly checking all production code
  (had missed `internal` when moving packages there)

### Changed

- All tooling is now part of the `go.mod` "tool" section. This means these
  tools are auto-installed when you simply pull dependencies, and are invoked
  via `go tool <name>`.
- Added `govulncheck`, the standard Go vulnerability checking tool. Activate
  via `make audit` or manually run `go tool vulncheck ./src/... ./internal/...`
