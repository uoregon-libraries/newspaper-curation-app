### Changed

- Job logs have been altered to allow for a much larger maximum ID to avoid
  catastrophic failures in the event one ever reaches ~2 billion entries.
  Unlikely to happen even in a decade of heavy use, but the new jobs could
  change that.
- Jobs were also given more "id space", as the new system spawns a lot more
  jobs than previously.
- NCA's codebase has been updated to handle larger IDs in all fields that could
  ever need them. We aren't updating them all (most could never posssibly reach
  2 billion), but we're prepared if we need to.

### Migration

- Turn off all NCA processes. Back up your database! Run migrations
  (`bin/migrate-database`). Start NCA services back up.
