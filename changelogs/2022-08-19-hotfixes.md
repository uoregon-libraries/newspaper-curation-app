## v3.13.1

Code-named "batch status page hotfixes". As promised, there were indeed several
very exciting bugs with v3.13.0. This release aims to fix the bugs we've
managed to catch so far after a bit of live use.

### Fixed

- Changelog no longer claims things were removed which in fact were not. Yeah,
  even the changelog had bugs.
- Batch status is properly set to "Ready for staging" after a batch is built
  instead of claiming to already be ready for QC (which means it's *on*
  staging).

### Added

- Batch reviewer and batch loader roles can now be assigned in the UI!

### Changed

### Removed

- Batch fixer CLI docs are properly removed. The page was removed from our Hugo
  docs, but the resulting HTML was accidentally not properly updated.

### Migration

If you generated any batches, their status will claim they're ready for QC. You
should load the batches onto staging such that that status is correct. Once
this fix is deployed, newly generated batches will correctly tell you they need
to be loaded onto staging.

You can also get around this by manually changing the batches' statuses to
`staging_ready` in the database, but this can be riskier if you don't know
precisely which batches in the database need to be changed.

The SQL **might** look like the below example. Tweak to suit your situation!

```sql
UPDATE batches SET status = 'staging_ready' WHERE status = 'qc_ready';
```
