### Added

- New script in `scripts/export-db.sh` for doing a partial database export,
  suitable for exporting live data for dev use. The export only grabs the last
  month's worth of data for the largest tables, so your exports will be usable
  for testing real-world data, and still very large, but not infeasibly so.
