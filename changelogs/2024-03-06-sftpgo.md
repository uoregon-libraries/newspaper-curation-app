### Changed

- Upgraded the docker SFTPGo version to 2.5
- Changed how NCA connects to SFTPGo on user updates to match the way SFTPGo
  2.5 works. This should be compatible with older SFTPGo versions.

### Migration

- If you're running an older version of SFTPGo you may have to upgrade to
  v2.5.0. I expect the NCA changes to be backward-compatible, but I'm not 100%
  certain.
- If you have a long-running dev setup for some reason, your SFTPGo database
  won't work with this update. You should generally just be okay to start
  fresh, as the docker setup isn't meant for long-term data storage, but if you
  absolutely need to keep your SFTPGo data intact, you'll have to either
  override the SFTPGo version (in `docker-compose.override.yml`) or figure out
  how to do the data upgrade manually. SFTPGo only works when migrating data
  one minor version at a time. e.g., assuming you were on v2.3, you'll need to
  get SFTPGo v2.4, migrate, then go to 2.5 and migrate again.
