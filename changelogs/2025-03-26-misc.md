### Changed

- Minor code refactors:
  - Terminology: batches now have an activity log, not "actions". Actions are
    what a user can do, not what's been done. This only changes the field name,
    sadly, not the database misnaming here.
  - The batch view template now keeps the various states separate so it's
    (hopefully) less messy to edit the HTML for a specific batch state.
  - A handful of comment improvements
- The issuefinder UI is now a bit easier to use, as it provides a typeahead /
  autocomplete search rather than a giant dropdown of all the titles.
- Minor improvements to the issuefinder "help" wording.
- All users can now use the issue finder since it's pretty safe, and has no
  destructive actions available.
