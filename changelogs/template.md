<!--
  Copy this file and give it a unique name for the change that it's adding.
  e.g., 2021-sftpgo.md. A file should always have essentially a one-branch
  lifetime. Feel free to only include the relevant sections for a given change,
  and ignore the version number if desired; it will probably change unless
  you're the release deployer.

  When preparing for a new release, all files here should be merged into the
  real CHANGELOG.md and deleted, and the version should be decided upon per
  semantic versioning specs.
